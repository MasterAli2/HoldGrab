# Hold Grab

## Overview

A mod for Lethal Company that lets you hold the grab button to pick up items

Rather than clicking the interact button everytime you can simply hold down the button then hover over an item to pick it up.

You can also hold and interact with non hold interact triggers continuously (such as the ship door buttons)

There is vanilla cooldown of 0.2 seconds for grabbing items.
